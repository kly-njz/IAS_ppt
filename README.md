# My IAS PPT USING NextJS

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, you will need to have two terminal windows open.

In the first terminal, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the web application, typically on http://localhost:9002.

In the second terminal, run the Genkit AI development server:

```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```

This will start the AI flows that power the summary generation.
